/**
 * This class contains nearly no logic but only simple and atomic getters and
 * setters. </br>
 * </br>
 * The life-cycle of a Fragment is quite complex to prevent the garbage
 * collection from running too often. When a fragment is no longer needed it
 * will be kept available in a queue, so it can be reused later on. The
 * life-cycle consists of the three flags: isInitialized, isLoading, and
 * isLoaded. isInitialized can be set to true from any thread, however setting
 * isInitialized to false as well as any modification to isLoading and isLoaded
 * will always be called from the fragment loading thread, to ensure a
 * consistent state. Also, isInitialized will only be set to true again after it
 * was set to false. It is not possible that isLoading or isLoaded is true while
 * isInitialized is false. It is also not possible for isLoaded to be true while
 * isLoading is true. </br>
 * </br>
 * It is possible that a thread that uses the data in the fragment continues to
 * use them after isLoaded is set to false. However, all write operations are
 * called from either the fragment loading thread, the threads from
 * {@link FragmentQueueProcessor#fragWorkers}, or the EDT during the
 * construction of the fragment. While the fragment is constructed it will only
 * be accessible by one thread. An exception to that rule is the instance
 * variable alpha. It is altered from the drawing thread, however this should
 * not cause any issues. </br>
 * </br>
 * Immediately after a new instance of this class is created, it is passed to
 * all FragmentConstructors. At that point in time, no other thread can access
 * the fragment, so the whole construction process is single-threaded. After the
 * fragment is constructed it will be available to use in the fragment graph. As
 * soon as it is requested, its isInitialized variable will be set to true by
 * the requesting thread. Also, it is enqueued to the loading queue. Note, that
 * the fragment is still not loaded, but used in the fragment graph and thus
 * used by the {@link Drawer}. Sometime after the fragment was requested, it
 * will go through the loading process, because it was enqueued to the loading
 * queue. </br>
 * </br>
 * During the loading process, the fragment loader thread will first check to
 * make sure that there are threads open in the fragment worker thread pool. If
 * it finds any threads that aren't executing anything, it will be passed to a
 * fragment worker to be loaded. When the fragment worker starts, it checks to
 * see if the fragment is already loading. If it is not, the isLoading variable
 * is set to true. This is to make sure that only one thread is loading the
 * fragment at a time. </br>
 * </br>
 * When this is done, the isLoaded variable will be set to true. This allows the
 * drawer to actually draw the fragment. The complete drawing process is
 * executed in the event dispatch thread. When the fragment is no longer visible
 * on the screen it will be removed from the fragment graph. However, since it
 * holds a data-structure that is quite heavy to allocate and garbage-collect,
 * the fragment will be recycled so it can be reused later. This recycling is
 * done by enqueuing the fragment to the recycle queue. The recycle queue is
 * processed by the fragment loading thread with a very high priority. Even
 * though the fragment loading thread only calls the method
 * {@link Fragment#recycle()} and enqueues the fragment to the available queue,
 * it is important that this is done by the fragment loading queue. This is,
 * because if any other thread sets the isLoaded variable to false, it might be
 * set to true by the fragment loading thread afterwards, because the fragment
 * was not yet loaded. This problem is solved by modifying the isLoaded variable
 * only in the fragment loading thread. This issue only arises, since the
 * fragment is already used in the fragment graph, before it is loaded. As soon
 * as it is used in the fragment graph it, can be recycled. This often leads to
 * a situation where a not yet loaded fragment gets recycled. The isInitialized
 * variable is altered by the thread that requests the new fragment, which is
 * different from the fragment loading thread. This is not an issue, since all
 * fragments in the available queue have both variables isInitialized and
 * isLoaded set to false. They are also not used in the fragment graph or
 * enqueued in the recycle queue. Therefore, there cannot be a race condition
 * because the isInitialized variable will only be set to false when it is
 * recycled.
