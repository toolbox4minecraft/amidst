/**
 * Bug https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-65214 was fixed in 15w46a, and the fix
 * changes where Ocean Monuments can appear. This class implements the
 * LocationChecker for after the fix was implemented.
 * 
 * The fix is described here:
 * https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-65214?focusedCommentId
 * =228462&page=com.atlassian
 * .jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-228462 That
 * description is quoted below:
 * 
 * ---- "The issue lies in that the server is calculating DEEP_BIOME based on
 * the 1.8 World Generator and NOT the worlds ACTUAL biome from previous
 * versions.
 * 
 * I had a report of a biome in OCEAN (Not Deep), and when I generated a 1.8
 * world with exact same seed, sure enough that location was DEEP_OCEAN in that
 * seed.
 * 
 * The Monument Structure check uses 2 different Biome lookup methods, and the
 * one that does DEEP_BIOME check uses the World Gen calculations, and then the
 * followup check for "Surrounding biomes" uses the actual worlds data.
 * 
 * I temp fixed for my server with the following change: - if
 * (this.c.getWorldChunkManager().getBiome(new BlockPosition(k * 16 + 8, 64, l *
 * 16 + 8), (BiomeBase) null) != BiomeBase.DEEP_OCEAN) { + if
 * (!this.c.getWorldChunkManager().a(k * 16 + 8, l * 16 + 8, 16,
 * Arrays.asList(BiomeBase.DEEP_OCEAN))) {
 * 
 * This issue has more flaws than this report states as it also causes monuments
 * to spawn in the middle of Rivers, Frozen Rivers and Frozen Oceans, which is
 * quite odd to stroll through the mountains and find a monument." ----
 * 
 * Examples: In seed -3189899870270394863, the monuments at (808, 1224) and
 * (-856, 184) are eliminated by this fix.
