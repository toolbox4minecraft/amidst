THIS IS A DRAFT

**Note:** The behavior described here is likely to be a superset of what will be available to the user (but the internal structures should support all these operations).

**TODO:**
- number of structures feature in criteria (should constraints returns multiple coordinates for reporting multiple structures?)
- score/result propagation for criterion references

### World
Consists of:
- a minecraft version
- a seed
- a world generator (i.e. a world type)
- world generator options (optional)
- a center point (all coordinates and areas will be taken relative to this center point)


### Predicate
Given a world and a coordinate, returns whether the coordinate satisfy a condition.

**Example:**
- being in a given biome
- being the center of a given structure
- being inside a given area (square, circle, etc)
- combinations of the above

**Note:** For ease of implementation, only predicates of the form `(biome1 OR ... OR biomeN) AND (structure1 OR ... OR structureN) AND area` will be expressible.


### Valuation
Given a coordinate, returns a positive value (higher is better)

**Example:**
- a constant valuation
- a higher valuation when the coordinate is closer to a given center point

### Constraint
Consists of:
- a Predicate
- a Valuation

Given a world, find among the coordinates which satisfy the predicate the one with maximum valuation, and returns it (along with its valuation). If more than one coordinate have maximum valuation, only one will be returned. If no coordinate satisfy the predicate, the constraint returns nothing.

**Short-circuiting:** When evaluating the constraint, we can stop testing coordinates as soon as we know that no non-tested coordinate will have a better valuation than the current one. (e.g. if the valuation is constant, we can return the first coordinate we find)


### Criterion
Given a world, returns whether or not it matches a certain condition.
If it matches, returns the resulting score (a positive number), and a list of matched constraints, along with their result.  
In addition to the score calculation specific to each type, a criterion also has an optional `score` attribute, whose value will be added to the score of the criterion if it matches.

The different type of criteria are:


#### A Constraint
A Constraint can be "lifted" to a criterion.
The criterion matches iff the constraint returns a coordinate, and its score is the valuation of this coordinate.


#### A reference to another criterion
Matches iff the specified criterion matches.
TODO decide how to propagate score/result

#### A Negation of another criterion
Matches iff the specified criterion DOES NOT match.
If it matches, ignore the result returned by the inner criterion, and return and empty match list, with a score of 0.

**Short-circuiting:** As the matches and the score of the inner criterion are ignored, we can abord as soon as the inner criterion is garanteed to match.


#### An `and` criterion
Consists of: 
- a list of children criteria

Matches iff all of its children match, and returns the results of all of its children; the score is the sum of the scores of all children.

**Short-circuiting:** If one children criterion doesn't match, we can immediately abort and say the `and` criterion doesn't match.


#### An `or` criterion
Consists of:
- a list of children criteria
- two optional attributes `min` and `minScore` (which are positive numbers, 0 by default)

Matches iff at least `min` children matches AND the sum of their scores is at least `minScore`. Only use criteria with a score of 0 if it is required for the criterion to match.

Returns the results of all of the matched children; the score is the sum of the score of all of the matched children.

**Short-circuiting:** If there is not enough untested criteria for the `or` to match, we can immediately abort. Also, we only test the criteria with a score of 0 only after testing all the others (and the `or` still hasn't matched).
